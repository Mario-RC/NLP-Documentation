###### Notes

Another interesting resource is the DAILYDIALOG (DD) dataset, which comprises about 13k dialogues obtained by crawling educational websites intended for learners of English and also has emotion label annotations. Many of the dialogues are focused on topics for ESL learners (ordering from a restaurant, asking for directions, introductions, etc), but only ≈ 5% of the utterances have a label other than “none” or “happy”.
